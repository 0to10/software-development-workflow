# Estimations and velocity

It's common for some details to be forgotten or overlooked during refinement of tasks for a sprint. Not responding on
time to tasks that are not well-defined may result in a failure to deliver the work that was committed to, because tasks
take more time to complete or scope is silently increased. Mitigating this risk requires an understanding of what the
work should look like, and knowing what to do if the work deviates from what was expected.

Each team _must_ agree on a set of questions to determine the expectancy of the work for each type of work.


## Examples of questions for software development

Below are a number of questions that may be used to determine the expected work for software development tasks:
- Which areas of the software application do you expect to be working on?
- Which other components / areas of the software application are related to the area you are expecting to work on?
- Are you expecting to primarily add, change or delete code?
- What is the coverage level of the code you are expecting to work on?
- Do you understand the purpose / business logic of the requested change?
- Are there any other pending tasks that will make changes to the same parts of the software application?
- Do I know who to reach out to if I come across any blockers[^1]?


## Before starting work

Before commencing with any work the agreed upon questions must be answered to understand the expected effort involved to
complete the work. During the first iterations of experimenting with this approach, the more senior members within the
team must support more junior members.


## Dealing with misunderstood work

Any deviation from the expected work must be discussed with the team. When or where deviations are discussed may differ
between teams, however:
- where deviations are discussed must be accessible throughout the day
- questions regarding misunderstood work must be answered within 1 hour[^2]
- a history of decisions regarding misunderstood work must be maintained
- all decisions from a sprint must be discussed during a retrospective




[^1]: A blocker does not have to be technical, be sure to have people to reach out to with any type of blocker.
[^2]: Teams may decide on another period but must agree on this with the rest of the organisation.
