# Reviewing

The peer-review process ensures that quality standards are met for every change to the software, but if not done
correctly it could result into a lot of spent time without any concrete benefits.

To keep up productivity while guarding quality, consider the review process a collaboration between the original
software engineer and a Reviewer. The people involved for a single task should not change, and the team should be aware
of who are responsible for the delivery of a task.

For the first review the Reviewer must provide comments to the software in the version control system. The original
software engineer will aim to resolve any comments made by the Reviewer, after the Reviewer has transitioned the task
back to "In Progress" and reassigned the original software engineer. When all the comments have been resolved, the task
is transitioned according to the workflow - as described above.

The Reviewer should watch for any tasks that are transitioned to the "Pending Review" state that the Reviewer previously
reviewed. These tasks should be reviewed again by the same Reviewer.

If any issues are found during the second review, the Reviewer should consider working directly together with the
original software engineer to resolve any remaining issues.
