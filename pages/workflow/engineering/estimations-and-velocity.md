# Estimations and velocity

As defined in the [Definitions](/pages/definitions.md) section, it should be possible to complete work on a task within
5 hours. Most companies have working days of 8 hours, which means that most tasks can be finished within a single
working day.

Software engineering frequently requires making modifications to many different parts of a software application. There
may be people in your team that thrive on elaborate changes, but for others it might be daunting. If work is left in an
unfinished state at the end of a working day, the software engineering that is working on the task will need to read
into the changes the next day. This takes time, and increases the change of making mistakes.

Tasks that exceed the desired 5-hour limit should be split up. Deliverables that need to be split up should be combined
into a story.
