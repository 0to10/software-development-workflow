# Refinement process

The Refinement process aims to keep the backlog of issues relevant, detailed and estimated. It is advisable to have
regular (scheduled) meetings to do Refinement of the backlog.

During a Refinement session the _Product Owner_ and some or all of the rest of the team reviews the issues on the backlog
to ensure the issues are still relevant, that they are prioritised and that the top of the backlog (at least enough issues
to fill the next sprint[^1]) is ready for development.

Some of the things that may happen during refinement of the backlog include:
- removal of issues from the backlog that are no longer relevant
- the relative priority between issues may change[^2]
- issues may receive an (updated) estimate
- issues may be split up because they are too big to handle in a sprint

It is advisable create new issues outside the Refinement session as much as possible.

Refinement should initially be done on a weekly basis, with 1-hour sessions. Increase the frequency of the sessions when
the planning session takes longer than 15 minutes.  
At the same time the frequency of the sessions may be decreased, or reduced in time, when the backlog of issues is
consistently in a good shape.


## Input for refinement

Input for the Refinement process can come from a variety of different sources. Below are a few examples of sources to
expect input from.

- the company roadmap and/or vision
- changes to rules and regulations, such as GDPR
- requests from customers and/or prospects
- growth of your customer base (scaling)
- changes to specifications, such as RFC's
- defects
- vulnerabilities
- ideas of your employees
- technology changes


## Output of refinement

The output of the Refinement sessions should be a backlog of issues that is relevant, understandable for the stakeholders
and estimated. The top of the backlog should at all times contain a list of issues that can be directly assigned to an
upcoming sprint.




[^1]: Reserve approx. 20% of the capacity of a sprint to resolve Defects.

[^2]: The relative priorities between issues may be determined by a) dividing the (expected) business value / estimated
time for development, b) highest technical debt value.
