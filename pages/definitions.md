## Unit of Work

> A unit of work is everything that needs to be done to complete (a piece of) a deliverable

Good examples of a unit of work are tasks, subtasks, defects and chores. Issues such as stories and epics are not
considered a unit of work.

A unit of work must...
- take between 1 and 5 hours to complete
- be something that is worth having a second pair of eyes look at
