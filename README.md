# Software Development Workflow

Whether you are part of a large organisation that employs thousands, or a small group within a startup, developing high
quality software is always on our mind. With many different stakeholders in every project, the checklist to get software
to the end-user seems to be growing every other week, and so keeping focus is key.

Decades of experience in software development has taught us a great deal about building software. We've put all of our
learnings into a simple process that helps to keep focus on the work, requires active collaboration between team members
and improves quality of the delivered software.

Many of the concepts and details of this workflow are based on other ideas, best-practises and studies, combined with
hands-on experience. The workflow incorporates ideas from Extreme Programming, Intent-Based Leadership (IBL), personality
and team composition studies, Domain Driven Design (DDD), and much more, but is in no way a replacement of studying those
yourself and building your own workflow or process.


## Getting Started

> It is recommended to only use this workflow when the team...
> - consists of at least 4 software engineers
> - has agreed on how to measure success
> - uses hours for estimations (not story points)
> - agrees to commit to this workflow
